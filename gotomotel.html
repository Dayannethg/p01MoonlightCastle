        <p class="storytext"> You guys decide to leave the car where it is and
        begin walking towards what you all assumed was a motel. The closer you get,
        you begin to realize it's not a motel. You turn to Eddy and Dug,"You guys,
        I think this is a castle and I'm not sure if I want to go inside anymore."
        "Shut up"-Says Eddy-"we walked all the way over here, it's late and I'm
        freezing, we're going to check it out!" Dug agrees, "You coming or you
        prefer to stay out here on your own?"
