        <p class="storytext"> Along with Dug you take a closer look at Eddy. We was shot and stabbed.
          "But who could have done this?" You're both in shock and you can't believ what just happened. Dug doesn't
            want to leave Eddy just lying there. He carries him to the car, where you all stay until the sun rises again.
        </p>
        <p class="storytext"> A car drives by and you ask for help. Instead of going up to the cabin, you turn the car around and head home
          to tell Eddy's family about what just happened. Your lives will never be the same and you both
          wish you had never planned this trip.
