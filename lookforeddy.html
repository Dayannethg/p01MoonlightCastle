          "Fine"- you tell him.You both stay close, it's already bad enough that one of you is lost.
          You both look throught he bushes and around the entrance to the castle. Still nothing. You yell out
          Eddy's name but there's no luck. You're both about to start heading back to where you were
          previously standing when you hear a faint rattle. You look down and sure enough, there's a rattle snake.
          You scream and Dug quickly kicks it away. As he does so, he notices something. By the bushes he spots what seems to be a shoe
          he takes a closer look and when he does he immediately jumps back. He just found Eddy's dead body.
