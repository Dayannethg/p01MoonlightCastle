        <p class="storytext"> You don't want to risk it so you head for the entrance. You run like there's no tomorrow.
          Someone who could have done that to Dug will not think twice about doing the same to you and Eddy.
          As you head out you realize the sun is rising. You think twice abotu it, but you decide to go back in and get Eddy.
        </p>
        <p class="storytext"> Eddy doesn't want to leave but at last you convince him. It's not easy for the both of
          you to jus leave Dug there but there's noting you could do. You apporach the car and as you do so another one drives by and
          gives you a hand. You guys turn the car around and head on home. You go straight to Dug's family and tell them what ahs
          happened. They gather everything they need and you guys show them the way to Dug.
          When you arrive at the castle and show them the way to the door where you last saw Dug, you're both shocked.
          All the weapons and the desk are gone. There's no more smell and... There's no more Dug.
