          go check it out" "Ok" say Dug. "Eddy you stay here in the car, we'll get off
          and see what's going on outside"</p>
        <p class="storytext"> As you're getting off, you both hear something. "Did you hear that?" you ask Dug.
          "Yes I think it's coming from over there". He points at some trees a couple feet away from the car.
          "Let's go check it out" he suggests.</p>
