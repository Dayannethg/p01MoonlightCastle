        <p class="storytext"> You decide to follow Eddy and Dug, it's too cold and
          scary to stay outside on your own. Who knows what could happen to you out there.
          The three of you use the flashlight from your phone to light the way.
          You can't really see anything around you, all you know is that when you reach out
          with your hand, all you can feel are cold brick walls that surround you.
          You keep on walking alongside with the guys. You're starting to get worried as a strange
          smell wraps around your nose</p>
          <p class="storytext"> "Eww! what's that smell", you tell the guys "it's disgusting!!" You're right" says Dug.
            "Look look!" says Eddy. You and Dug turn his way. Right in front of you guys there are two doors.
            "What do you think is behind the doors?"-You ask the others "I don't know but it can't be anything good
            if it's giving off that awful smell"-Affirms Dug.  </p>
