          "Stop being a baby" Dug teases you, "Let's just see what's behind these doors, it can't be so bad. Maybe that awful smell is
          coming from some dead animal or something" "Or maybe a dead someone!" you worriedly tell him. "Fine, you stand here, I want to
          see what's behind those doors" Dug insists. Eddy follows him. They each approach one door. You're too afraid to see what's behind the doors
          but you're also too scared to be left alone. You're upset with Dug, so you just follow Eddy. Eddy slowly opens the door.
          You want to turn around but now you really want to see what's behind that door.</p>
        <p class="storytext">"Ha" says Eddy, "See there's nothing to worry about, there's nothing here." You're
          relieved yet a bit disappointed. This is lame, let's head on out. Eddy and you head on out the door, making sure the door
          is closed behind you, just how you found it.</p>
