        <p class="storytext">It's winter break and you and your two bestfriends;Eddy and Dug can't wait to get on
        the road and head out to your uncle's cabin up in the mountains. You had
        all been planning this for the past 4 months and can't wait to get up there.
        You all hop in the car and drive off into the sunset.</p>
        <p class="storytext">You have been driving for about two hours when the car begins to feel funny.
        The car gives off a creeking noise before all of a sudden breaking down
        in the middle of nowhere. "Don't worry"- says Dug- "I'll check it out, I'm
        sure it's nothing to worry about." After trying everything he could, Dug
        still wasn't able to start the car again. It was getting dark, and being
        the middle of December the temperature seemed to be dropping by the minute. In the distance
        Eddy spootted what seemed like a motel. He turns to you and Dug and with a shivering voice says,"Look
        you guys, I'm freezing and we're practically in the middle of nowhere.
        But look, there seems to be a motel not so far from here I think we should
        go look for help, or atleast spend the night and we'll figure out what to do tomorrow"</p>
