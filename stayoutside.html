        <p class="storytext"> What feels like an eternity has gone by and you
          begin to regret your decision. For a moment you think about going inside
          with Eddy and Dug but you can't see them anymore. And what if you did go inside
          and got lost and the guys can't find you? "No!, I'm not going to risk it,
          I decided to stay out here and I'll stay out here. Plus how long can it take them?
          I hope not too long!!!" </p>
        <p class="storytext"> You hear a rattling noise near the bushes next to the entrance to the castle.
          You ignore it, "it's probably an animal, they'll go away" you say to yourself.
          No more than two minutes later, you hear it again but this time it was louder.
          You're starting to get scared but you also want to find out what it might be.</p>
