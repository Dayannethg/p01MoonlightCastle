        <p class="storytext"> You tried to fight all you could but he was too big, too strong, too evil.
          You scratched and clawed at his face, at his hands but there was nothing more you could do.
          You got tired as he slowly took the life out of your eyes. You give up. You stopped resisting,
          you stopped scratching. You stopped trying. This was it. As he pressed harder against you,
          you can feel your last breaths escaping your body. You could see it in his blue eyes how much he enjoyed this.
          How happy it made him to be the one that robbed you of those many years that waited you. In a matter of seconds, you were dead.
        </p>
      <p class="storytext"> He gets up and leaves. He just left you there on the cold ground for the animals to eat your flesh.
          But don't worry, that didn't happen. Eddy and Dug came running out of the castle, only to find you lying there lifeless.
          They carried you to the car as the sun was rising. A car drove by and helped them get the car started. They truned the car
          around and drove back home to break the news to your family.
          You were loved, and you will be missed.
