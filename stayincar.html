        <p class="storytext">You all agreed that the best thing was to sleep in
          the car over night and that you'll figure out what to do once the sun
          was up again. This is not how you planned to spend your first night of
          winter break, but there's nothing you could do. "At least we're all together
          and we can keep each other safe"-you thought. </p>
        <p class="storytext"> You couldn't have been asleep for more than an hour when
          the buzzing of your phone woke you up. Shoot! Your phone's completely dead. Isn't this great!
          You toss your phone onto the car floor.
          As you try to go back to sleep, you hear footsteps coming from the back of the car.</p>
