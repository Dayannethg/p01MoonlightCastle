        <p class="storytext"> Dug is taking forever so you decide to approach the door and just take a peek
          to hopefully find out what is taking him so long. You stick your hed through the door and all you can see is
          Dug sitting quitely in a chair. "Psht Psht Dug lets go" you whisper but he doens't reply. "Come on this isn't funny
          we have to get out of here". No response, You walk in and approach him to see what's holding him back. You scream!
        </p>
        <p class="storytext"> There's a puddle under his chair. It's a puddle of blood. As you get closer you realize that his hands are chained
          down to the table. His feet are as well, you look at him to ask him what's going on and you see it. His throat is slit.
          You scream and yell out for Eddy. Eddy can't believe it. Your instinct is to run out of that place as soon as possible but Eddy
          can't seem to move. HE soesn't want to leave Dug behind. At last you convinvce him. It's not easy for the both of
            you to jus leave Dug there but there's noting you could do. You apporach the car and as you do so another one drives by and
            gives you a hand. You guys turn the car around and head on home. You go straight to Dug's family and tell them what ahs
            happened. They gather everything they need and you guys show them the way to Dug.
            When you arrive at the castle and show them the way to the door where you last saw Dug, you're both shocked.
            All the weapons and the desk are gone. There's no more smell and... There's no more Dug.
