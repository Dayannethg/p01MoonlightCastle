        <p class="storytext"> This is not how it's going to end. You fight for your life. You twist and turn
          but his heavy body won't let you get free. You see your chance and you take it. You bite his hand. He screams and jumps
          back, this is your chance to run. You run away from him as fast as you can but from the corner of your eye you see he
          gets up. He's running after you. You run faster, but he manages to catch up and pin you down again. You keep on fighting
          you're not giving up that easily. He manages to position himself on you in a way that it's impossible
          for you to break free and its getting harder and harder for you to keep on fighting. After a while, you get tired.
        </p>
      <p class="storytext">You give up. You stop resisting,
      you stop scratching. You stop trying. This was it. As he pressed harder against you,
      you can feel your last breaths escaping your body. You could see it in his blue eyes how much he enjoyed this.
      How happy it made him to be the one that robbed you of those many years that waited you. In a matter of seconds, you're dead.
      He gets up and leaves. He just left you there on the cold ground for the animals to eat your flesh.
         But don't worry, that didn't happen. Eddy and Dug came running out of the castle, only to find you lying there lifeless.
         They carried you to the car as the sun was rising. A car drove by and helped them get the car started. They truned the car
         around and drove back home to break the news to your family.
         You were loved, and you will be missed.
