        <p class="storytext"> You're finally able to calm down and with Eddy, you take a closer look at Dug. It appears
          to be that his throat was slit open and his hands were chained down to the table along with his feet to the chair
          he was sitting on. You both can't believ what has happened to Dug. He was killed in a matter of seconds.
          But how did this happen? You were both right next door for no more than half an hour. You start to think, if someone did this to
          Dug without thinking twice about it, they can do it to us too.
        </p>
        <p class="storytext"> You tell Eddy and he agrees. But Eddy doesn't want to leave Dug behind. At last you convince him. It's not easy for the both of
          you to jus leave Dug there but there's noting you could do. You apporach the car and as you do so another one drives by and
          gives you a hand. You guys turn the car around and head on home. You go straight to Dug's family and tell them what ahs
          happened. They gather everything they need and you guys show them the way to Dug.
          When you arrive at the castle and show them the way to the door where you last saw Dug, you're both shocked.
          All the weapons and the desk are gone. There's no more smell and... There's no more Dug.
