          That's just crazy. You'll wait for the guys to get back, they should be back any minute now. What's taking them so long?
          Did something happen to them? No, it can't be, they're just fine. It's been like what? 20 minutes now?
          They should be almost here again. This place isn't that big. Or is it? Ok ok, everything's fine it was just a rabbit or something.
          Nothing dangerous.</p>
        <p class="storytext"> As you try to assure yourself that there's nothing to worry about behind those bushes, you hear it again.
          But this time it seems as if the noise got louder and closer. "Everything's fine" you tell yourself "nothing's going to hap-""
          "BOO!" a large dark figure jumps out of the bushes. "Ahhhh!" you scream. "Gotcha!" says Dug.
          He had been hiding in the bushes all this time. "YOU STUPID MORON!!!, You scared me to death!!"
          "Sorry" says Dug, "I thought it was funny" "Well it wasn't, now where's Eddy?"
          Dug turns around,"He's right he- wait! he was just here, where'd he go?"
