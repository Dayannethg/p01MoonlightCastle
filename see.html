        <p class="storytext"> Eddy and yourself didn't find anything interesting behind your door.
          Now as you apporach Dug's door, that nasty smell from earlier begins to get stronger.
          Now both you and Eddy are worried as to what you might find once you walk through that door. You both pause before the door
          and share a worried look. After about 5 seconds, you both walk in.</p>
        <p class="storytext"> The first thing you both see is Dug, his back is facing the two of you as
          he sits behind what looks like a desk. As you spot Dug, you also realize what's on the walls.
          There are various chains, whips, and knives among other weapons. At first you don't understand
          what all of this is. But then you begin to put it all together. This appears to be a torture vault.
          Meanwhile, Eddy is approaching Dug. "Hey man, let's go this place is giving me the creeps." Dug doesn't
          respond."Come on, this isn't funny get your butt up and let's go" he tells Dug again. Still no answer.
          Now you approach Dug and as you do so you notice something strange. There's a puddle under his chair. You
          don't know what it is. It's not until you're a couple inches away from him that you realize what it is.
          "Ahhhhh!" You scream. "WHAT?!" says Eddy. "It's a puddle of blood." You say as you run for the door.</p>
