        <p class="storytext">Eddy wasn't in the car anymore and the approaching footsteps suddently stopped.
          You looked down beside you and there was what seemed like footsteps leading into the trees nearby. You look at Dug
          and tell him what you just saw. He suggests to follow the trail.</p>
