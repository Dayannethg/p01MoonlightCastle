        <p class="storytext"> You slowly walk towards the bushes. Now that you're getting closer, it
          seems like its nothing but you still decide to go check it out just to make sure. You scramble the bushes
          a little but there's nothing there. You feel relief. As you turn your back and start heading to where
          you were previously standing, the rattling is there again. You turn around, and take a couple steps towards
          the bushes. This time you spot something. As you make your way to find out what it is, a black figure jumps right on
         top of you.</p>
        <p class="storytext"> You try to make out a scream, but he has all his weight on top of you and one of his hands over your mouth.
          You struggle but it doesn't seem to make a difference. "This is it" you think to yourself. There's no one around to
          help you and all you can see are your attackers blue eyes and the shadow of his hoodie.
