        <p class="storytext"> You and Eddy decide to wait for Dug to come out. He shouldn't take too long.
          If there was nothing behind your door, there's probably nothing behind his door. A good 10 minutes
          go by and Dug is still not out. You tell Eddy to go look for him but Eddy doesn't want to, he says he'll be out soon.
          You're impatient and just want to get out of that ugly place so you decide to go in and look for Dug. Eddy
          follows right behind you with the excuse that he doesn't want you to be alone
          when the truth is he is scared.
