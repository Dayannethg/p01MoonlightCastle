        <p class="storytext">You run away crying. You can't see Eddy like this. Why? Why did this happen? How did this happpen?
          you run towards the car. Dug stays with Eddy. As you're walking towards the car you hear footsteps
          approaching. you turn around and a body jumps over you. He was covered in blood and you right away knew it was Eddy's blood.
          You scream and in teh distance you can see Dug running towards you. You feel relieved. He's coming to save you. The
          attacker hears him apporaching, takes out a gun from his left pocket and while pinning you down positions
          his body so he is able to point it at Dug. It a matter of seconds, he shoots Dug and Dug falls to the ground.

      <p class="storytext">You ket out a scream because it was then that you knew there was no way you were going to be safe.
        You fight as much as you can but he's stronger, he's heavier, he's pure evil. As he pressed harder against you,
        you can feel your last breaths escaping your body. You could see it in his blue eyes how much he enjoyed this.
        How happy it made him to be the one that robbed you of those many years that waited you. In a matter of seconds, you were dead.
        He gets up and leaves. He just left you there on the cold ground for the animals to eat your flesh.
